# PyPPMS Changelog

NOTE: potentially breaking changes are flagged with a ðŸ§¨ symbol.

## 2.2.0

- `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.get_systems_matching()` now raises a `TypeError` in case
  the parameter `name_contains` is accidentially as `str` instead of a list.
- `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.get_running_sheet()` now has an optional parameter
  `ignore_uncached_users` (defaulting to `False`) that allows to process the running
  sheet even if it contains users that are not in the `fullname_mapping` attribute.
- If the `cache_path` attribute is set for an `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection` instance but
  creating the actual subdir for an intercepted response fails (e.g. due to permission
  problems) the response-cache will not be updated. Before, the exception raised by
  the underlying code (e.g. a `PermissionError`) was passed on.
- Methods of `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection` are now sorted in alphabetical order, making
  it easier to locate them e.g. in the API documentation.

## 2.1.0

- [API] `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.get_user()` and
  `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.get_user_dict()` now both accept an optional parameter
  `skip_cache` that is passed on to the `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.request()` call
- [FIX] `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.update_users()` now explicitly asks for the cache
  to be skipped

## 2.0.0

- [API] ðŸ§¨ the signature for `pyppms.user.PpmsUser` has been changed and now
  expects a single argument (the PUMAPI response text)
- [API] ðŸ§¨ the constructor signature for `pyppms.system.PpmsSystem()` has been
  changed and now expects a single argument (a dict as generated by
  `pyppms.common.parse_multiline_response()`)
- [API] ðŸ§¨ the constructor signature for `pyppms.booking.PpmsBooking()` has been
  changed and now expects the PUMAPI response text, the booking type (if the
  booking is currently running or upcoming) and the system ID
- [API] ðŸ§¨ the following methods have been removed as their behavior is now
  achieved by the corresponding default constructor of the respective class:
  - `pyppms.user.PpmsUser.from_response()`
  - `pyppms.system.PpmsSystem.from_parsed_response()`
  - `pyppms.booking.PpmsBooking.from_booking_request()`
