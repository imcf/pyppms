# PyPPMS Changelog

## 2.0.0

- [API] the constructor signature for `PpmsUser()` has been changed and now expects
  a single argument (the PUMAPI response text)
- [API] the constructor signature for `PpmsSystem()` has been changed and now expects
  a single argument (a dict as generated by `pyppms.common.parse_multiline_response()`)
- [API] the following methods have been removed as their behavior is now achieved by the
  corresponding default constructor of the respective class:
  - `PpmsUser.from_response()`
