# PyPPMS Changelog

## 2.2.0

- `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.get_running_sheet()` now has an optional parameter
  `ignore_uncached_users` (defaulting to `False`) that allows to process the running
  sheet even if it contains users that are not in the `fullname_mapping` attribute

## 2.1.0

- [API] `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.get_user()` and
  `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.get_user_dict()` now both accept an optional parameter
  `skip_cache` that is passed on to the `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.request()` call
- [FIX] `pyppms.ppms.PpmsConnection.update_users()` now explicitly asks for the cache
  to be skipped

## 2.0.0

- [API] the signature for `pyppms.user.PpmsUser` has been changed and now expects a
  single argument (the PUMAPI response text)
- [API] the constructor signature for `pyppms.system.PpmsSystem()` has been changed and
  now expects a single argument (a dict as generated by
  `pyppms.common.parse_multiline_response()`)
- [API] the constructor signature for `pyppms.booking.PpmsBooking()` has been changed
  and now expects the PUMAPI response text, the booking type (if the booking is
  currently running or upcoming) and the system ID
- [API] the following methods have been removed as their behavior is now achieved by the
  corresponding default constructor of the respective class:
  - `pyppms.user.PpmsUser.from_response()`
  - `pyppms.system.PpmsSystem.from_parsed_response()`
  - `pyppms.booking.PpmsBooking.from_booking_request()`
